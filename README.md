# protocls-vs-abc

A common question among the Python developers is whether to use protocols or abc module and when to put each of these two in a proper way.

Have a look at `abc_usecase.py` and `protocls_usecase.py` to grasp the difference and when it is suitable situtation for abc or protocols use.

Keep in mind, they serve the same purpose but are different in a way, so it is essential to understand when to use which tool.

Protocols are almost the same as abc, but allows you to use ducktyping instead of explicit typing.
